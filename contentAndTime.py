'''
Content and time: Links the content features and has the main timing logic for posting articles. 
Timing logic will have a boolean feature within so that it can be stopped if it isnâ€™t working from a command. 

Goal is to have the bot check for articles and videos regularly (2 hour spans between 8 AM and 10 PM, stop at night)
