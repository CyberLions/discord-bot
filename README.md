# discord-bot
A Discord bot for the CCSO Server

Goal of the bot: To provide new features and something that the club can maintain for the future

Features to Implement

RSS Feed (Dev name): This feature will help automatically post cyber related articles. The goal of this feature is to help make the server appear more active and to promote discussion. https://github.com/bluddy/discord-bot-rss-feed

Link posting (Youtube notif) (Dev name): This feature will be for YouTube videos and other things that we can find as well. https://dev.to/oskarcodes/send-automated-discord-messages-through-webhooks-using-javascript-1p01 https://mattdemers.com/guide-automate-discord-posts/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnOY_fUF2tI *Look for custom music bots

Reaction Roles (Dev name): This feature will allow members to react to receive a new role. We will also be able to use this feature to post announcements and rule posts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXjsCiUjUqo

Integration with CTFd Platform (Dev name): This feature will hopefully connect to the CTFd platform and be able to give leaderboard updates and announcements on new challenges. Have no idea if it will work.
