# Roles Module

This module supports the 'react' role buttons. The `Prebuilt` submodule contains commands that have embeds with roles that are specifically targeted to the CCSO discord server.

## Commands:
- /reactroles
    - Allows an admin to create react role buttons. No embed will be included with this command.
    - Creating buttons for roles that have `Administrator` permission is prohibited for security reasons.
    - Default permission required to use: Administrator
